# Advent Of Code

This repo is created to follow the Advent Of Code annual coding challenge.

The code will be written in Python. The coder is a noob.
It's been years since last using Python.

Almost all commented out code, (and comments) will remain in the code. This isn't an attempt to minify or optimize (at least yet).
